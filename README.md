A* pathfinding using Pathfinding.js and Phaser. The client page is also served through Node.js

Keep in mind that this is not complete. I was in the middle of adding a mechanism to save map data in MongoDB and have it served to the client but I did not complete it. 

The main take-away from this demo repo is using Pathfinding.js with Phaser and Tiled tilemaps.
